# RegEnforcer
Registry monitoring tool that checks to see if keys are modified, alerts the user, and revert changes.

## Overview
Many features in Windows can only be enabled through the Windows Registry. However, these settings can be altered unexpectedly by Windows itself, third-party tools, or Windows Updates. RegEnforcer addresses this issue by monitoring specific registry keys and alerting you to any modifications.

## Development
This program is developed using C# with WPF. Most of the coding was done through a process known as vibe coding (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), with the exception of this readme file. I utilized Grammarly to enhance its clarity and correctness.

## Inspriation
As a loyal fan of Windows Weekly (https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly), I have taken inspiration from Paul Thurrott, who has frequently suggested that listeners contribute by developing helpful tools. This is my way of giving back, especially since I have not joined Club Twit (https://twit.tv/clubtwit).
